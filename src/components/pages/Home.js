        A mathemagician is a mathematician who is also a magician. The term
        &quot;mathemagic&quot; is believed to have been introduced by Royal Vale
        Heath with his 1933 book &quot;Mathemagic&quot;.. The name
        &quot;mathemagician&quot; was probably first applied to Martin Gardner,
        but has since been used to describe many mathematician/magicians,
        including Arthur T. Benjamin, Persi Diaconis, and Colm Mulcahy. Diaconis
        has suggested that the reason so many mathematicians are magicians is
        that &quot;inventing a magic trick and inventing a theorem are very
        similar activities.&quot; Mathemagician is a neologism, specifically a
        portmanteau, that combines mathematician and magician. A great number of
        self-working mentalism tricks rely on mathematical principles. Max Maven
        often utilizes this type of magic in his performance. The Mathemagician
        is name of a character in the 1961 children&apos;s book The Phantom
        Tollbooth. He is the ruler Digitopolis, the kingdom of mathematics.
